        <h2>Life History </h2>
        <img width="200" height="250"  src="images/wueeh.jpg">
        <p>My name is Tabitha Aluel from Southern Sudan. I have 
            two brothers and one sister. I can say I have passed through
             many difficulties during childhood. I was born in Kakuma. The place
              was so hot that anyone would barely afford to wear clothes, especially at
               night. I then relocated to Eldoret where I am still living to date.  My dream
                course has always been law. But due to unavoidable circumstances, I have not 
                achieved it. Remember, God doesn't close one door without getting ready to open 
                another with bigger and greater things. Actually, I was able to find another
                 opportunity in Akirachix. Currently, I am studying Information  Technology 
                 at AkiraChix. I believe by the end of this program, I would be somewhere working and earning.

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <img width="200" height="250" src="images/Majok's.jpg" >
    <p>My goal is to be an independent woman in the future by having my
         own money since I am tired of being <q>a parasite.</q> It sucks to depe
         nd on other people. I would not depend on other people for eve
         rything forever. It is my responsibility to work extra hard to 
         reach my goals. If there is one piece of advice I can give you,
         it's this- when there's something you want, fight for it, do not
          give up no matter how hopeless it seems. Remember the best things 
          in life don't come free. I would do whatever it takes to reach my 
          goals. My dream is also to uplift my family and I pray to God to help me 
          through my journey.  
    
        My hobby is reading novels, listening to music, watching drama movies and dancing. During
         my leisure time, I  watch Tiktok videos and sometimes do
         dancing challenges. I also love staying within my limits
          and having peace of mind. I am the kind of person who hates arguing.
           I would rather keep my mouth shut than quarrel.  </p>
